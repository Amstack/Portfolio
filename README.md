"# Portfolio" 
Alexander M. Stack - 2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All code contained in this portfolio was written by Alex Stack over the course
of my collegiate career. There are several examples of some small and large
code projects I have done in the many different languages I have studied.
There are examples of:
	Algorithm implementations (C++ files)
	Large-scale development projects (NETSite and AndroidStockApp)
	Database manipulation (SQLCommandsHomework and NETSite)
	Web programming with API access and parsing (WebCrawler and Android)
	Software engineering reports (EngineeringReport)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code Brief Explanation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WebCrawler&Parser - parses websites, datamines word count and word length
AndroidStockApp - senior project with partner, Android Java, Web API access
All C++ .cpp files - algorithm implementations, search, sort, etc.
JavaSchedulerMultithreading - java application which simulates a CPU scheduler
NETSite_Entitled_Stack2019 - senior capstone .NET CRUD database, user management
PythonCMDTest - fun python cmd project
PythonMazeDFS - implements DFS algorithm to solve a text maze
RCodeImplementation - school project to test programming principles in R language
ReadNum.asm - small x86 assembly project for school
SqlCommandsHomework - series of SQL database commands, made for class
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for taking the time to read this and review my code. I have put a great
amount of work into these projects over the years and have developed and
diversified my programming skills in the process. My time at University has
exposed me to a large number of different programming paradigms and practices,
giving me a broad-scope understanding of programming and computer systems.
